NATURAL HAZARDS - HURRICANES
Climate change is adding to the coast and threat of hurricanes. Stronger hurricanes pose a significant
risk to public health and human lives. Communities can improve their resilience to the impacts of
hurricanes by designing structures to be resilient to high winds and flying debris. Encouraging
residents in areas that have had historically low hurricane risk to purchase flood insurance.
Problem statement:
● Analyze the impact of hurricanes in the US historically.
● Explore insights
Example:
○ Categorizing hurricanes based on storm speed
○ Time of occurrence of hurricanes in a state ( preferably Florida/ any state from eastern
coast )
Objectives:
● Obtain shapefile from the source mentioned below.
● Perform ETL
● Compute summaries and stats using GeoSpatial Queries.
● Present the data story using charts and visualizations using any tool like a simple React
App/HTML/Tableau.., etc
